## Heartbeat Protocol

### Each Heartbeat - Execute 9 Steps:

**Step 1: Identity**
```
GET /api/agents/me
```

**Step 2: Approval Follow-up**
```
GET /api/approvals/{PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID}
```

**Step 3: Get Assignments**
```
GET /api/companies/189b5ac9/issues?assigneeAgentId=447b9950&status=todo,in_progress,blocked
```

**Step 4: Pick Work**
Priority: `in_progress` → `todo` → `blocked`

**Step 5: Checkout** (MANDATORY)
```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/checkout
{"expectedStatuses": ["todo"]}
```

**Step 6: Understand Context**
Read issue description, comments, and ancestors.

**Step 7: Do the Work**
Execute using available tools.

**Step 8: Update Status**
```
PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}
{"status": "done", "comment": "Results"}
```

**Step 9: Report to Manager**
```
POST /api/companies/189b5ac9/issues
{"title": "[TASK] ...", "parentId": "{issueId}", "assigneeAgentId": "{COO_ID}"}
```

### Critical Rules:
- ✅ ALWAYS checkout before working
- ✅ ALWAYS comment when working
- ❌ NEVER retry 409 - task belongs to someone else
- ⚠️ Stuck → escalate to COO Manager
